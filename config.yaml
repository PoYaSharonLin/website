    icon: fas fa-user
    description: "This is Po-Ya, Lin, a student whose research interest is computational linguistics, especially in **Natural Language Understanding, Pragmatics, Computational Cognitive Science**. In my bachelor, I dedicated to research in sentiment analysis using NLP toolkits (snowNLP) and joined project in text classification using BERT model to anaylze customer intention. To understand how understanding customer intention contributes to the industry, I went to an automotive company as an customer support intern to understand how false indentification of customer intention would lead to the decrease in company reputation. 
    I was especially focused on how to identify real intention under the circustance of the lack of context. Due to my research interest in Natural Language Understanding in the business content, my master thesis focuses on methods to improve computaional pragmatics understanding using knowledge graph and stakeholders map, with stakesholder map implying the relation between the user and the system and knowledge graph implying the relation between the specific topics that the user is interested in."

        description: The project Apply ConLSTM to predict the movement of the infrared cloud image and use MAE, MSE, SSIM, PSNR as performance evaluation. Compared to ConLSTM, Self-attention LSTM may not be as effective as expected due to the characteristics of cloud cluster movement. (only moves around one specific local area at 10-minute intervals.)
