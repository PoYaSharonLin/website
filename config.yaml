    description: |
      I am Po-Ya Lin, an NLP enthusiast with a focus on **natural language understanding** and **computational pragmatics**. 
      My work includes sentiment analysis in Mandarin text, fine-tuning BERT for text classification. <br><br>

      I gained hands-on experience in **intent detection** while working as a Customer Support AI Chat Intern, 
      where I improved chatbot performance by refining classification techniques. My current research focus is **"Computational Pragmatics Understanding: Intent Classification Using Knowledge Graphs with BERT."** <br><br>

        description: The project Apply ConLSTM to predict the movement of the infrared cloud image and use MAE, MSE, SSIM, PSNR as performance evaluation. Compared to ConLSTM, Self-attention LSTM may not be as effective as expected due to the characteristics of cloud cluster movement. (only moves around one specific local area at 10-minute intervals.)
